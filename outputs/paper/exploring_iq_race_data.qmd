The question of race differences in intelligence began to be scientifically studied in the middle of the nineteenth century [@Lynn]. In 2015, Dr. Richard Lynn published the first fully comprehensive review on the historical and current evidence of the race differences in intelligence worldwide. In this document, we are interested in examining one of Dr. Lynn's dataset on the disparity between the intelligence quotient amongst different races, with the direct purpose of discussing its relation to an important quote by Dr. Srinivasan, "I think we should be suspicious when we find ourselves attracted to data---very, very thin and weak data---that seem to justify beliefs that have held great currency in lots of societies throughout history, in a way that is conducive to the oppression of large segments of the population" [@Cowen]. To conduct this investigation, we use workflow and code similar to Example 2.3. of Chapter 2 of *Telling Stories with Data* [@Rohan].

## 1. Plan

Figure 1 on p. 2 shows a quick sketch of a potential dataset and resulting graph. The dataset should list the important ethnic races, alongside their measured intelligence quotient (Figure (1(a)), and the final graph should display this data as a bar chart (Figure 1(b)).

## 2. Simulate

We first set up the workspace by downloading necessary packages in R, as follows.

```{r message = FALSE}
#### Workspace setup ####
#install.packages('tidyverse')
#install.packages('janitor')
#install.packages('formatR')
#install.packages('opendatatoronto')
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(formatR)
library(opendatatoronto)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80), tidy=TRUE) # prevent source code from running off PDF page 
```

To simulate the data, we create a dataset of two variables: `race` and `IQ`. Reasonable values for `race` would be the 11 races to which Dr. Lynn makes reference, these being "Arctic Peoples, Northeast Asians, Europeans, Native Americans, South Asians, North Africans, Bushmen, Sub-Saharan Africans, Australians, Southeast Asians, Pacific Islanders"; reasonable values for `IQ` would be randomly sampled from a normal distribution with mean, say, `100`, and a standard deviation of `15`.

```{r}
#### Simulate #### 
set.seed(853) # for reproducibility
simulated_iq_data <- 
  tibble(
    race = c(
      "Arctic Peoples", "Northeast Asians", "Europeans", "Native Americans",
      "South Asians", "North Africans", "Bushmen", "Sub-Saharan Africans",
      "Australians", "Southeast Asians", "Pacific Islanders"
    ),
    IQ = round(
      rnorm(
        n = 11,  
        mean = 100,
        sd = 15
      )
    ) 
  ) 

print(simulated_iq_data)
```

## 3. Acquire

We use Table 16.2 in Dr. Lynn's *Race Differences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis* (2015). As the table is not directly downloadable as .csv file, we have copy pasted the data ourselves into an Excel file and thereafter converted it to a .csv file.

```{r}
#### Acquire data ####
raw_iq_race_data <-  read_csv(file = "race_iq_data.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

#### Save data ####
write_csv(x = raw_iq_race_data, file = "raw_iq_race_data.csv")
```

We may quickly inspect the first six rows of the data set by using `head()` .

```{r}
head(raw_iq_race_data)
```

To make this dataset similar to the one in which we are interested (Figure 1), we will need to change its columns using `clean_names()` and reduce the columns to only the relevant ones using `filter()` .

```{r}
iq_race_data_clean <- clean_names(raw_iq_race_data) |> 
  select(race, iq)
head(iq_race_data_clean)
```

Having appropriately cleaned the dataset, we now save it.

```{r}
write_csv(x = iq_race_data_clean, file = "cleaned_iq_race_data.csv")
```

## 4. Explore

We explore and visualise the dataset just created by making a bar graph. In Figure 2, we use `ggplot2` of `tidyverse` to build a graph of the IQ of various races.

```{r}
#### Explore data #### 
cleaned_iq_race_data <- read_csv(file = "cleaned_iq_race_data.csv", 
                                 show_col_types = FALSE)
ggplot(cleaned_iq_race_data, aes(x = race, y = iq)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "IQ Scores by Race",
       x = "Race",
       y = "IQ Score", 
        caption = "Figure 2: Bar graph of IQ scores for various races.") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + # centre title 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for legibility 
```

## 5. Share

Since the middle years of the nineteenth century, scientific studies concerning race differences in intelligence, and the extent to which they are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, began to emerge [@Lynn]. The definition of intelligence proposed by the American Psychological Association in 1995, and accepted by Dr. Lynn, is the ability "to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking thought" [@Neisser]. We were interested in visualising the data of the IQ of these eleven categories of races adopted by Dr. Lynn, being Arctic Peoples, Northeast Asians, Europeans, Native Americans, South Asians, North Africans, Bushmen, Sub-Saharan Africans, Australians, Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders.

We used the data provided in Table 16.2 of Dr. Lynn's *Race Differences in Intelligence* (2015). We cleaned, tidied anad analysed the dataset using the statistical language R [@R] as well as `tidyverse` [@tidyverse], `janitor` [@janitor] and `formatR` [@formatR] packages. We then created a histogram of the purported race-based differences in intelligence.

Dr. Lynn's collected data appears to be consistent with the hypothesis that differences in intelligence amongst races exist. From his data, it is clear that Northeast Asians, Europeans and Arctic Peoples possess, on average, the largest IQs of 105, 100 and 91, respectively, and Sub-Saharan Africans, Australians and Bushmen possess, on avaerage, the least IQs of 71, 62 and 55, respecitively. The remaining races can be seen to cluster close together around a mean IQ of 86 and standard deviation of roughly 1.4.

It would appear that these findings justify commonly-held stereotypes and beliefs, as to the differential intelligence and --- therefore, in the view of some, worth --- of various human races. Consistent with the aforementioned quote by Dr. Srinivasan, this data, that supports the hypothesis of inherent and immutable differences in the intelligence between human races, could contribute to the marginalisation and oppression of certain racial and ethnic groups in modern society. To question the validity of the data, and to scrutinise the means by which it has been acquired and analysed, is thus a necessary question for future study. For instance, it is important to critically examine the selection criteria for the eleven specific ethnic groups chosen for the study, and question whether these are regarded as valid ways across the scientific community of categorising people. In addition, it is important to question the validity and reliability of IQ tests across different cultures and ethnic groups, as cultural bias in testing methods, language proficiency and socio-economic factors may significantly affect IQ scores [@Lee]. In general, there are various societal and environemental factors, such as access to education, economic opportunities, and healthcare, can significantly impact intelligence test results. A simplistic attribution of intelligence differences to genetics and race alone would overlook these factors.

Another future area of study is to consider the ethical implications of this nature of research, which suggests intellectual differences between races and, thus, can reinforce harmful stereotypes and contribute to discrimination. In going against principles of fairness, equity and justice, it is crucial to make a thorough investigation into its ethical implications.
