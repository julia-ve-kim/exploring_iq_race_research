## Overview

This repo contains the data sources, cleaned dataset, R scripts and the paper (along with files used to generate it) for the analysis of the dataset of the difference in the IQ amongst eleven categories of races, as published by Dr Lynn's Race differences in Intelligence: An Evolutionary Analysis (2015). 

 The main purpose of this research is to discuss its relation to an important quote by Dr. Amia Srinivasan, stated on the Conversations with Tyler podcast, "I think we should be suspicious when we find ourselves attracted to data—very, very thin and weak data—that seem to justify beliefs that have held great currency in lots of societies throughout history, in a way that is conducive to the oppression of large segments of the population" (2021). 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
